# Smart Street Light System Based on IoT

An IoT-based automation project that intelligently controls street lighting to optimize energy consumption and improve urban infrastructure.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project involves the development of a smart street lighting system that uses sensors and microcontrollers (like Arduino/NodeMCU) to automatically manage street lights based on environmental factors such as ambient light and motion detection. It helps reduce unnecessary power usage and promotes smart city implementation.

## 🔧 Key Features

- Automatic switching of lights based on ambient light levels
- Motion detection to activate lights only when needed
- Energy-efficient and scalable design
- Real-time data collection and remote monitoring (optional feature)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Hardware**: Arduino / NodeMCU, LDR sensor, IR sensor, Relay Module, LEDs
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, C/C++
- **IoT Platform** *(optional)*: Blynk / ThingSpeak / Firebase (for remote control & monitoring)


## 📗 Future Improvements

- Integrate with solar panels for off-grid operation
- Add cloud-based analytics dashboard
- Enable scheduling and manual override via a mobile app
